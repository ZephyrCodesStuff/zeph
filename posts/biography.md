Hello there, I'm **zeph**.

If you're here, it's probably because you've found my website from something like Discord or GitHub, or you're an HR manager looking to see if I'm a good fit for your company.

## Education

I'm currently studying **Computer Engineering** in Italy and working a part-time job as a **Software Developer**.

I've graduated from a technical high school focused on urban construction, environment and land surveying, with a final grade of 96/100.

I've also been rated C2 in English from the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), with a score of 8.5 overall.

## About me

I'm a 19-year-old **full-stack software developer** from Italy, with around **7 years of experience**, as of 2025.

I mostly do backend engineering, but whenever I need to, I'll gladly write some frontend code.

In addition to that, I also do some DevOps work and some reverse-engineering of games and other software.

## Coding

I've been coding since I was 12 years old, starting with Visual Basic and Windows Forms, making apps like tools for Skyle or other minor projects.

Coding has stuck with me the most since it allows me to create anything I can imagine, needing nothing but a little bit of creativity and a lot of determination to learn.

### What I usually work with

- **Languages**: Rust, TypeScript, Python, C#
- **Frameworks**: NextJS, React, TailwindCSS, Tauri (for apps)
- **Databases**: MongoDB (certified), SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Cloud Services**: Docker, Terraform, Google Cloud

### Projects

Honestly, there's way too many to list here (over 91 repos on GitHub alone), so I'll just give you a few of the most notable ones.

Please note that **some of these are closed-source**, so I won't be linking them.

### [zephs.me](https://zephs.me)

This is the website you're on right now.

I've made it using NextJS, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript, without base templates.

### [destinationhome.live](https://zephs.me:3000)

A website I made for a project I'm leading; a revival project for the now defunct game "PlayStation Home".

It has been shutdown in 2015, but my group has managed to fully reverse-engineer its servers, and we're currently in the process of reviving it.

Some of the notable features include:

- A fully responsive design for both mobile and desktop
- A beautiful light/dark mode
- A modern tech stack

In addition to the website, I've also created all of the API servers the game uses, in addition to various Discord bots and internal tools for our staff team to use.

### [blåhaj](https://github.com/ZephyrCodesStuff/blahaj) (private)

![The BLÅHAJ logo](/posts/blahaj.png)

> Yes, I've made the logo myself.

Extremely versatile and fast cryptography suite for the above project. It's a multi-purpose, cross-platform swiss-army knife that can do things like:

- Encrypting and decrypting files, using custom-made encryption algorithms.
- Compressing and decompressing files, using modified versions of ZLib and LZMA.
- Pack and unpack files using Sony's "SDAT" format.

It comes as a CLI, a library and even a GUI, and uses a modular architecture to allow for easy extensibility.

It's entirely written in Rust and uses statically-linked C/C++ libraries for compression (ZLib, LZMA), so it can run on literally anything, including your toaster and your Samsung Smart Fridge (seriously; I've ran it on a Samsung Smart TV).

### [archange](https://github.com/ZephyrCodesStuff/archange-rs) (private)

A CUDA GPU-accelerated compression and archiving tool.

Archange harnesses the computational power of GPUs to compress files into a tiny, portable `.arc` file.

It achieves this by being written in Rust, while using a CUDA backend for raw GPU computation.

It uses the `nvCOMP` libraries from NVIDIA to compress and decompress files, and it implements multiple cryptographic algorithms, including GPU-accelerated versions of AES, XTEA and a simple XOR-based cipher.

It's capable of surpassing tools like 7-zip when ran on a modern GPU.

### [reverie](https://github.com/ZephyrCodesStuff/reverie-rs) (private)

"Reverie" used to be my main project, but I've since moved on to other things.

It's a complete messaging platform, featuring:

- Cross-platform, native apps (think Windows App SDK with WinUI 3)
- A fast API in Rust and GraphQL
- MongoDB and Redis for storage, caching and real-time pub/sub
- Features like servers, channels, friends, mutuals, etc.

I've probably spent around 2 years on this project, and I've learned a lot from it.

## Hobbies

In addition to coding, I love other creative hobbies, such as:

- **Piano**
- **Guitar** (acoustic and electric)
- **Photography**
- **Video editing**
- **Musical production and sound design** (I *love* synthesizers)

## Contact

You can contact me via [Discord](https://discord.com/users/110107013207306240) or email at [zeph@zephs.me](mailto:zeph@zephs.me).
